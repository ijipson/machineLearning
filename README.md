# machineLearning
#Hello, this is my repository where I have all the work I completed for a Machine Learning Specialization course!

#To see the final product, you can go into each folder and click the file that ends in .ipynb, and it will open up the notebook post-run, so there is no need for additional software.

#The coolest project so far is either Course3_Week3, where I used reinforcement learning to create a Deep Q Algorithm to land a model of the Mars Rover, or Course2_Week4, where I used Decision Trees algorithms to sort mushrooms by color and whether or not they are poisonous, so feel free to check it out!
