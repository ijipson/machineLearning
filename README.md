# machineLearning
#Hello, this is my repository where I will be uploading all the work I complete for a Machine Learning Specialization course!
#To see the final product, you can go into each folder and click the file that ends in .ipynb, and it will open up the notebook post-run, so no need for additional software.
#The coolest project so far is Course2_Week4 where I used Decision Trees algorithms to sort mushrooms by color and whether or not they are poisonous, so feel free to check it out!
